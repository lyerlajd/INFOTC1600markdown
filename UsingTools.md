## **Summary of “These Monkeys Are 3,000 Years into Their Own 'Stone Age'”:**
A new site, described in *Nature Ecology & Evolution*, was discovered in the Serra da Capivara National Park in Brazil. A record of capuchin monkey tool-use has been discovered dating back 3,000 years. This discovery makes the site the oldest archaeological site of non-human tool use outside of the African continent. While there are older sites in Africa, the site in Serra da Capivara shows variations over time in the shape of the tools, which suggests the capuchins adapted their tools to the foods they were eating.

>"What is really interesting about the ability to conduct archaeological excavations on primate tool-use sites is that we as a species are not unique in having a   really fine-grained and detailed archaeological record,” says study coauthor Tomos Proffitt, a postdoctoral fellow at University College London. “This capuchin     excavation shows that this species of primate in Brazil has its own individual archaeological record; they have their own antiquity to their tool use.”
    
Having a greater understanding of how tool use changes over time for capuchins could provide insite on how early humans used tools. Around 3.3 million years ago, hominids used chiseled pieces of rock as tools, but it is hypothesized that they used stones, similarly to how the capuchin monkeys in the Serra da Capivara do now, to process food. The capuhcins use stones to break open cashews.

While the stones have changed sizes and even the foods the capuchins eat have varied, not all of the researchers believe this shows signs of advancement. It is stressed that while capuchins can use stones as tools, they still have not made some of the major advancements hominids did like using thin pieces of stone to cut things.

Some extra facts from the article:
* Several birds also use tools
* Chimpanzees have used 'spears' to hunt small mammals

## **Summary of “Six Talking Apes”:**

### Viki: 

Viki was a chimpanzee who got the closest to spoken language. She learned 4 spoken words total (mama, papa, cup, and up). Because of the anatomy of apes, human language is extremely difficult to replicate. She was able to learn this much because she was treated like a human and raised at the home of Keith and Catherine Hayes. Her life unfortunately ended quite early at only the age of 7, so it's possible she would have been able to learn how to say even more words.

### Washoe:

Washoe was the first ape to be taught sign language. She learned about 250 signs and could put them together in small combinations. Washoe also had a child, Loulis, who learned some signs from his mother. This made him the first ape to learn sign language from another ape.

### Nim

Nim was raised as a human similarly to Washoe, but was later moved to a laboratory. It was eventually concluded that Nim never actually learned language.

### Chantek

Chantek was an Orangutan who learned sign language. He learned around 150 signs and was able to recognize himself in mirrors; another behavior only common to humans.

### Koko

Koko was a gorilla, and is probably the most famous ape to have learned sign language. She knew around 1,000 signs and could understand some spoken English. There were also claims that Koko had an IQ score a bit lower than average for humans, but there were not many scientific publications backing this.

### Kanzi

Kanzi is a bonobo who learned to communicate using lexigrams instead of sign language. Scientists were trying to teach Kanzi's mom, but it was Kanzi who ended up picking it up. She understand some spoken English and knows around 400 symbols.
