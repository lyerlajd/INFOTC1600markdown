# Using Tools

A new site, described in *Nature Ecology & Evolution*, was discovered in the Serra da Capivara National Park in Brazil. A record of capuchin monkey tool-use has been discovered dating back 3,000 years. This discovery makes the site the oldest archaeological site of non-human tool use outside of the African continent. While there are older sites in Africa, the site in Serra da Capivara shows variations over time in how tools are used. 

>"What is really interesting about the ability to conduct archaeological excavations on primate tool-use sites is that we as a species are not unique in having a   really fine-grained and detailed archaeological record,” says study coauthor Tomos Proffitt, a postdoctoral fellow at University College London. “This capuchin     excavation shows that this species of primate in Brazil has its own individual archaeological record; they have their own antiquity to their tool use.” (Greshko)
