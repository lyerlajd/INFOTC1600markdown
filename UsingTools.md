## **Summary of “These Monkeys Are 3,000 Years into Their Own 'Stone Age'”:**
A new site, described in *Nature Ecology & Evolution*, was discovered in the Serra da Capivara National Park in Brazil. A record of capuchin monkey tool-use has been discovered dating back 3,000 years. This discovery makes the site the oldest archaeological site of non-human tool use outside of the African continent. While there are older sites in Africa, the site in Serra da Capivara shows variations over time in the shape of the tools, which suggests the capuchins adapted their tools to the foods they were eating.

>"What is really interesting about the ability to conduct archaeological excavations on primate tool-use sites is that we as a species are not unique in having a   really fine-grained and detailed archaeological record,” says study coauthor Tomos Proffitt, a postdoctoral fellow at University College London. “This capuchin     excavation shows that this species of primate in Brazil has its own individual archaeological record; they have their own antiquity to their tool use.”
    
Having a greater understanding of how tool use changes over time for capuchins could provide insite on how early humans used tools.
