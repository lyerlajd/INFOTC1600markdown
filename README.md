# Primates: The Cutting Edge
## By James Lyerla

### **Introduction**

Recent research into primates has revealed some interesting developments. While there is lots of new information, summaries for two articles are linked below. Understanding how other primates learn and evolve in the wild could give insight into how humans came to be and some of the steps along the way. 

### **[Tool Use](https://github.com/lyerlajd/INFOTC1600markdown/blob/main/UsingTools.md)**

This article is on capuchin monkeys using stones as tools. It talks about how the tools have changed over time, and how early hominids may have used stones similarly.

### **[Language](https://github.com/lyerlajd/INFOTC1600markdown/blob/main/InterSpeciesPlay.md)**

This article is about six apes that learned some kind of language; one thing that is commonly said to put humans apart from other animals. While it does not always, work, there are also examples of success with teaching apes sign language or even speaking.
