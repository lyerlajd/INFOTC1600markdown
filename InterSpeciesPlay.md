## **Summary of “Six Talking Apes”:**

### Viki: 

Viki was a chimpanzee who got the closest to spoken language. She learned 4 spoken words total (mama, papa, cup, and up). Because of the anatomy of apes, human language is extremely difficult to replicate. She was able to learn this much because she was treated like a human and raised at the home of Keith and Catherine Hayes. Her life unfortunately ended quite early at only the age of 7, so it's possible she would have been able to learn how to say even more words.

### Washoe:

Washoe was the first ape to be taught sign language. She learned about 250 signs and could put them together in small combinations. Washoe also had a child, Loulis, who learned some signs from his mother. This made him the first ape to learn sign language from another ape.

### Nim

Nim was raised as a human similarly to Washoe, but was later moved to a laboratory. It was eventually concluded that Nim never actually learned language.

### Chantek

Chantek was an Orangutan who learned sign language. He learned around 150 signs and was able to recognize himself in mirrors; another behavior only common to humans.

### Koko

Koko was a gorilla, and is probably the most famous ape to have learned sign language. She knew around 1,000 signs and could understand some spoken English. There were also claims that Koko had an IQ score a bit lower than average for humans, but there were not many scientific publications backing this.

### Kanzi

Kanzi is a bonobo who learned to communicate using lexigrams instead of sign language. Scientists were trying to teach Kanzi's mom, but it was Kanzi who ended up picking it up. She understand some spoken English and knows around 400 symbols.
